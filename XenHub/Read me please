This is (most of) the source code of Xen Hub (https://scriptblox.com/script/Xen-Hub_113)

'Developed' by Ice_ and ! Fire (pasted open source stuff into a lua file, turned it into a hub and called it theirs, they're quite lame people tbh)

The things I was able to the source of:
1. The loader
2. Giant Simulator
3. Ninja Legends
4. Prison Life
5. Legends of Speed

Things I was NOT able to get the source of:
Pet Simlulator X
Anime Simulator X

Additional stuff in there:
A loader with the whitelist check REMOVED, so you can use this hub without being whitelisted, yay! (Though I don't see why anyone would want to use this...)
